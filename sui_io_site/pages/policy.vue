                    reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected
                    personal information or an authorized representative, which
                    may include confirming the email address associated with any

                    >,” we may offer referral programs or other incentivized
                    data collection programs. For example, we may offer
                    incentives to you such as discounts or promotional items or
                    credit in connection with these programs, wherein you
                    provide your personal information in exchange for a reward,
                    or provide personal information regarding your friends or
                    colleagues (such as their email address) and receive rewards
                    when they sign up to use our Services. (The referred party
                    may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.)
                    These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow
                    our business and provide additional benefits to you. The
                    value of your data to us depends on how you ultimately use
                    our Services, whereas the value of the referred party’s data
                    to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately
                    becomes a user and uses our Services. Said value will be
                    reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each
                    program.
